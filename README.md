## üî¨ How It Works

The core of HootSpot is the `SYSTEM_PROMPT`. This prompt instructs the Google Gemini API on its role and the required output format. It does not contain a hardcoded list of tactics.

1.  When you submit a text for analysis, the extension sends it to the Google Gemini API along with the `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
2.  This instructs the AI to act as an expert in linguistics, psychology, and rhetoric and to find matching patterns in your text based on its own training.
3.  The Gemini API is required to return a structured JSON response containing the analysis.
4.  The extension parses this JSON and renders an interactive, multi-part report in the side panel, including the summary, visual chart, and highlighted text.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

### For Users (Recommended)

The easiest way to use HootSpot AI is to install it from the Chrome Web Store.
